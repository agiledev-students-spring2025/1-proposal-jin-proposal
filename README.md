# Bubble: Emotional Music Connection Platform

## What and Why
Bubble helps people connect and manage their emotional wellbeing through music. While research shows music's therapeutic benefits for trauma healing, emotional support, and mental health, no existing platform specifically leverages these benefits. Bubble fills this gap by creating an accessible, low-cost alternative to traditional mental health support through collaborative music experiences.

## For Whom
Our initial users will be:
- College students struggling with stress and anxiety who already use music as a coping mechanism
- Local mental health support groups seeking alternative therapy tools
- Music therapists who need a platform to assign and track music-based activities

## How
Bubble creates an interactive music experience through:
- Emotional Bubbles: Visual representations of songs based on their emotional impact, allowing users to connect their interpretations with others
- Smart Recommendations: Personalized song suggestions based on user's current mood and past preferences
- Mood Tracking: Simple tools to log emotional states and identify music that helps

## Scope
For 4-6 developers over one semester, this project is feasible because:
- Core features (bubbles, basic recommendations) can be built using existing web technologies
- Integration with Spotify API reduces music infrastructure needs
- Optional features like advanced AI recommendations can be added if time permits
